                            I am a Full Stack developer with 1+ years' of coding experience in the IT industry. I have familiarity with
                            building CRUD applications, RESTful APIs using Java as language and Spring Boot as Framework.
                            I have experience on gradle- and maven-based projects. I came across building JPA,
                            Hibernate, Security in Spring Boot. I faced Unit Testing using JUnit and Mockito and
                            Integration Testing using Postman and Spring MockMVC. I have also used to create an APi-first approach
                            using Swagger, implemented in Spring (Java) and Angular (TypeScript). I have experience in Spring
                            Microservices as well. I have acquaintance with building UI using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.
                            I also used Angular with TypeScript and React with JavaScript for UI solutions.
